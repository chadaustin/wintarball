Ever had to deal with those pesky .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 files in Windows?
WinTarBall makes it easy.  Simply double-click or right-click on a tarball and
decompress.  Need to create archives for your freaky bearded UNIX friends?
Right-click on the folder or file you want to archive, and select the compress
command.  It's as easy as that.  :)

WinTarBall adds a new control panel that allows you to configure the bzip2 and
gzip compression levels.
